    <h1>TEMPERATURE CONVERTER</h1>
    <p>This  web application is used to interconvert the temperatures from one unit to other unit. <br> 
        this application supports different temperatures such as celcius ,kelvin, fahrenheit,rankine and raumer. </p>

<h2>Details about temperature</h2>
<p>Temperature is a physical quantity that quantitatively expresses the attribute of hotness or coldness. Temperature is measured with a thermometer. It reflects the average kinetic energy of the vibrating and colliding atoms making up a substance.

    Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature scales that historically have relied on various reference points and thermometric substances for definition. The most common scales are the Celsius scale with the unit symbol °C (formerly called centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale (K), the latter being used predominantly for scientific purposes. The kelvin is one of the seven base units in the International System of Units (SI).
    
    Absolute zero, i.e., zero kelvin or −273.15 °C, is the lowest point in the thermodynamic temperature scale. Experimentally, it can be approached very closely but not actually reached, as recognized in the third law of thermodynamics. It would be impossible to extract energy as heat from a body at that temperature.
    
    Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, medicine, biology, ecology, material science, metallurgy, mechanical engineering and geography as well as most aspects of daily life.</p>
    <h3>Effects of temperature</h3>
    <p>
        Many physical processes are related to temperature; some of them are given below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the physical properties of materials including the phase (solid, liquid, gaseous or plasma), density, solubility, vapor pressure, electrical conductivity, hardness, wear resistance, thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, strength</li>
        <li>the rate and extent to which chemical reactions occur</li>
        <li>the amount and properties of thermal radiation emitted from the surface of an object</li>
        <li>air temperature affects all living organisms</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scales</h3>
    <p>Temperature scales need two values for definition: the point chosen as zero degrees and the magnitudes of the incremental unit of temperature.

        The Celsius scale (°C) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world. It is an empirical scale that developed historically, which led to its zero point 0 °C being defined as the freezing point of water, and 100 °C as the boiling point of water, both at atmospheric pressure at sea level. It was called a centigrade scale because of the 100-degree interval. Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though numerically the scales differ by an exact offset of 273.15.
        
        The Fahrenheit scale is in common use in the United States. Water freezes at 32 °F and boils at 212 °F at sea-level atmospheric pressure.</p>
